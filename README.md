The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly, interactive To-Do List web application that enables users to efficiently create, manage, and track tasks in real-time, with persistent storage across sessions. The application leverages client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide a seamless experience, incorporating features like task addition, status toggling, deletion, and data persistence using local storage, while ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
